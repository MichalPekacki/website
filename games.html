                        <h3>Modern Warfare 2</h3>
                        <p>Modern Warfare 2 is another game in the so popular Call of Duty series. 
                        In my opinion it is the best game I have ever played due to the friendly experience
                        you get from the gameplay. Although with the technology we have right now the graphic 
                        of the game is not impressive I still love coming back to it and playing it. The
                        campaign is good and the story has a good depth to it, however it is the multiplayer
                        which makes this game so enjoyable.</p>

                        <h3>Skyrim</h3>
                        <p>Skyrim is another outstanding game with much depth and hours of gameplay. The
                        combat system is not as good as, for example, Dragon's Dogma however it is still
                        enjoyable. The game has a lot of content and the graphics are stunning. The game
                        gives you choices and you are responsible for how you want to play the game. Endless
                        hours of exploration, combat and quests await you at every moment, you simply cannot
                        get bored.</p>

                        <h3>Heroes of Might and Magic V</h3>
                        <p>Heroes of Might and Magic is a strategic game where you choose a faction and explore
                        the land to find resource essential for your development. The end goal is defeat other
                        factions who oppose you so in order to do that you need to expand your faction. It is a
                        very good turn base strategic game with beautiful environment and in depth gameplay.</p>

                        <h3>Dark Souls</h3>
                        <p>Dark Souls is one of the best games I have ever played, the combat in the game is
                        very good and the game mechanics are very challenging. What I like about the game is the
                        fact it is so challenging. Most games guide you through their world where as this game
                        simply gives you a quick tutorial of controls, the rest is for you to figure out. With no
                        maps or quick saving system it is very hard to progress. The story is mysterious and hard
                        to understand but the game is very atmospheric.</p>

                        <h3>Fifa 16</h3>
                        <p>Fifa 16 is a football game. You control you team and try to score against the opposition.
                        What is so good about the game is its challenging mechanics and the different types of play.
                        You can choose to play a simply quick game, make a player or manager career or play ultimate
                        team where you build your team in a card trading manner. The career mode is very in depth and
                        endless which gives you hours of gameplay.</p>
