            <p>After I leave university I am looking to become a computer
                games developer. My aspiration is to become an independent,
                also known as indie, games developer, this means I will work
                by myself or in a small team to create a game. This is because
                I will be able to have big impact on the game and have the
                freedom to be creative. In bigger companies that work on AAA
                games you have to work under the demand of the customer. This
                doesn’t mean I wouldn’t work for a big company such as Blizzard,
                this would give me experience and I would be able to learn of 
                more people who have much more experience than me. With that 
                experience I would then like to make my own game which hopefully
                will be as successful as other indie games such as Minecraft or
                World of Goo.</p>
